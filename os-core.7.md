os-core(7) -- Base files for Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture
====================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`init`
`root filesystem`
`shell`

## DESCRIPTION

os-core provides a minimal base for the Clear Linux OS for Intel
Architecture. It contains required utilities for running the init program
systemd, letting users log in and run bash shell commands. The core also
contains pieces of packages that are required to run any other package in
the distribution.

This is the only required bundle for Clear Linux OS and can not be removed
as all other bundles depend upon it.
